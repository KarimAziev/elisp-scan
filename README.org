** Usage

The simplest usage is to invoke transient popup ~M-x elisp-scan-menu~ or ~M-x elisp-scan-list-menu~ with such commands:

*** ~elisp-scan-all-unused-defs~
Same as ~elisp-scan-project~ but with predefined filters to show only unuse items. 

This commands will activate =elisp-scan-report-mode= with keymap:
