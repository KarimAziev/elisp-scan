  :straight (elisp-scan
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "KarimAziev/elisp-scan"))
#+end_src

*** Manual

** Usage
   
The most straightforward usage is to invoke transient popup ~M-x elisp-scan-menu~ and ~M-x elisp-scan-list-menu~ (in report buffers).

- ~elisp-scan-file~ Scan the Elisp file and show the report.
- ~elisp-scan-dir~ Scan elisp files in the directory and show the report.
- ~elisp-scan-project~  Scan project files and show the report.
- ~elisp-scan-all-unused-defs~ Same as ~elisp-scan-project~ but with predefined filters to show only unused items. 

This command will activate =elisp-scan-report-mode= with such bindings:

| Key       | Command                                 |
